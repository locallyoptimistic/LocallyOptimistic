Welcome to Locally Optimistic -- a blog for current and aspiring data analytics leaders. Started in NYC in early 2018 as an outgrowth of a slack channel / extremely informal meetup group, we hope to share our thoughts / opinions / experiences / trials / tribulations with others in the community.

If you have content that you would like to contribute (or if you just want to chat about data stuff), please reach out.

Quick note: The views and opinions expressed on this blog are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers

### Scott Breitenother

Scott is an investor and advisor who specializes in building data driven organizations. He was employee #16 at direct-to-consumer mattress startup [Casper](https://casper.com/) and founded the company’s Data & Analytics team. In a former life, Scott was a Management Consultant (which is probably where he developed his love of frameworks and structure). When he’s not blogging about analytics trends, you can find him walking around Brooklyn with his wife and daughter.

### Sam Swift

Sam is the Head of Data at [Bowery Farming](http://boweryfarming.com/how-it-works), where "seed funding" refers to budget allocations between kale and arugula. He hails from an academic background in behavioral economics, but has led data science teams in national intelligence and fintech before landing in agriculture. He enjoys building communities and hearing about the details of other people's projects, so don't be shy in the comments.

### Ilan Man

Ilan is the Head of Data at [Trialspark](http://www.trialspark.com) where he's helping to modernize the clinical drug trial process in order to bring drugs to patients who need them, faster. He loves thinking about numbers, optimal bike routes around the city, and how we lack Free Will (obviously he wrote that). When he isn't thinking, he's running around Prospect Park or riding his bike to Bear Mountain.
