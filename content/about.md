Welcome to Locally Optimistic -- a blog for current and aspiring data analytics leaders. Started in NYC in early 2018 as an outgrowth of a slack channel / extremely informal meetup group, we hope to share our thoughts / opinions / experiences / trials / tribulations with others in the community.

If you have content that you'd like to contribute (or if you just want to chat about data stuff), please reach out.

Michael cut his teeth applying econometric research methods to a variety of fields from environmental economics to child welfare policy to healthcare outcomes and treatment efficacy. Currently, he leads the analytics team at Harry's helping the new-wave men's grooming brand "make better decisions faster."

In his spare time Michael drinks too much coffee, reads, and occasionally thinks about going to the gym.
